# Placeholder for CloudFront Private Key
# DO NOT COMMIT THE ACTUAL KEY TO GIT!
# 
# For development (local):
#   1. Copy your cloudfront_private_key.pem file here
#   2. It's in .gitignore so won't be committed
#
# For production (Dokploy):
#   1. In your Dokploy app settings, add an environment variable:
#      - Name: CLOUDFRONT_PRIVATE_KEY_CONTENT
#      - Value: Your entire PEM file content (with actual newlines)
#   2. Or place the file at: /etc/cloudfront/private-key.pem via Dokploy's file upload
#
# The code will check in this order:
# 1. ./cloudfront_private_key.pem (this directory - for dev/local use)
# 2. /etc/cloudfront/private-key.pem (Dokploy mounted file)
# 3. Environment variable CLOUDFRONT_PRIVATE_KEY_CONTENT
